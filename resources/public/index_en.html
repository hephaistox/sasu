        <meta name="description" content= "I'm Anthony CAUMOND, and I have quite a unique combination of skills: supply chain, computer science, and optimization research. I've founded Hephaistox to make them happen together in offers appropriate for small and medium enterprises, as we can deal with all the aspects of a project with a small team. This makes confidence, cost reduction, and consistency mandatory for the small teams of Hephaistox's customers." >
